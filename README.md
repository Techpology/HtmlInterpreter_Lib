HTMLi 0.1a

Object based html compiling:
You can create entire web pages using c# classes with a fully working hierarchy and components system.
This is a key feature to our main new introduction to the industry which I will explain further in the upcoming section.

Masterpage-singlepage approach:
Our library comes with a prebuilt masterpage - singlepage system which means that you can have a design patters very similar to the one in ASP.net.
Which then brings us to the pure html component system which brings in aspects from ReactJs to pure html using our assembler.

STACS (STANDARD CACHING SYSTEM):
STACS is our caching system, where you can handle all your project files from a single static class instantly with very few lines of code.
It is made to help with the management of the Solution. Which brings us to our next point.

Solutions:
We use a project Solution system which means that you can handle your entire project with just a single file created aside from the compiled files.
Very similar to visual studios solution system.

The highlight of our library
Alpha 0.0.1 - yet to be fully stable
VPA (Vanilla Parser):
We are very proud to introduce our new parser/compiler to the industry, allowing the binding of the designer and the developer flawlessly.
We are the first library to allow the creation of pure human readable code using GUI, and the editing of pure handwritten code without any pre requirements of using our system using GUI(Frameworks included). You can create a website in WordPress and later import it with only 2 lines of code to your project where the entire DOM tree will be recreated for you using our Object handling system which allows for full compatibility and editing of a completely platform separate website using our library/software.
